## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

- This exercise marked the end of the PHP modules of my course
- The design was free but demanded the use of Bootstrap and being responsive oriented
- Since it is PHP focused, the field validation is only made on the backend side
- I later reworked it on order to make it more readable
- I also used namespace and PHP autoloader out of curiosity during that rework
- This rework also served as a template for the HealthKerd project
